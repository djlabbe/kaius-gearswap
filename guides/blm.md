==General Information==

===Roles===
Black Mage is a dynamic job which can make it daunting to play to its fullest. Which it arguably needs to in order to justify its position in a party. Seeing how BLM isn't the only magic game in town. With jobs like SCH putting out superior support while also packing nukes or a job like COR or RNG staying out of range and dropping powerful magical weapon skills. While otherwise still being able to engage in TP/WS burn melee DD party setups. Couple this with the general mechanics learning curve to the job as fine tuning damage varies across all foes rather than mindlessly meleeing it in the face dead. With the fact that BLM, while no longer critically dependent on needing all the support in the world, is dependent on magic bursts to do real damage. Despite the general ignorance or disregard of skill chains or not interrupting them as you furiously try to burst your balls off.<br />
All creating a perfect storm for what is wrongly considered a job in the worst position in this game. Rather than the challenging, but uniquely rewarding and fun job it is. That is right, Black Mage is more than niche, and far from a bad job. You will get out of it what you put into it, and hopefully this guide allows the community the direction it so desperately needs.

Black Mage should be expected to:
\*Deal elemental damage
**Switching between bursting or free nuking sets.
**Know the elemental weaknesses of the foe.
**Magic Burst, whether solo or coordinating with a group.
**Understanding the gist of magic accuracy and magic damage, detailed in a section below.

\*Support
**[[Elemental Debuff]]s and [[Impact]] are powerful
**You can and should cure. Which means gearing for it.
**Crowd control with Sleepga, Bind, Stun, and Breakga. \***/SCH provides the potential for Dispelga as well.

\*Be frontline or backline
**BLM can and should WS to SC in various situations.
**BLM has Mana Wall, and can use it well.
**BLM has the ability to generate TP without meleeing via [[Occult Acumen]]
**BLM has access to AoE WSs and Spells.
\*\*It is often not appropriate to run just because you have hate.

\*Have robust equipment sets
**This is not a job to be lackadaisical with. Play something else then.
**Inventory is a problem if you play other jobs. See [[Inventory 201]] for tips.

{{Guide Support Jobs
|Border Color=#51414F
|Job=WHM
|Notes=An important sub for not only the White Mage line of spells, especially the eventual Curaga III at ML10, but for Weapon Skills. As this is generally the preferred sub for gaining access to [[Earth Crusher]] and [[Cataclysm]].

Otherwise, /WHM gives access to the same enfeebles as /RDM, sans Gravity with more party support. In the form of Barspells, Cuaraga, Haste, -na spells, etc.
}}
{{Guide Support Jobs
|Border Color=#51414F
|Job=RDM
|Notes=A handy support job for Haste, Flurry, Refresh, Barspells, Silence, Paralyze, Slow, Gravity, Convert, and extra Fast Cast.

Red Mage as a support job feels like a middle ground between the offerings of White Mage and Scholar. However, Convert and Refresh are overshadowed by Dark Arts, Parsimony, and Sublimation of /SCH. Meaning you generally would sub this if you needed the remaining tools it offers over you other subs.
}}
{{Guide Support Jobs
|Border Color=#51414F
|Job=SCH
|Notes=Arguably the most useful support job overall for Black Mage. Especially when you hit ML5. [[Parsimony]] allows for greater MP management, [[Alacrity]] allows for more rapid -ja accumulation or recast spells such as Death or Comet for targets weak to our limited dark nukes, [[Manifestation]] allows for the rare, but funky Dispelga and Aspirgas, and [[Ebullience]] brings bigger nukes if all else isn't needed.<br />
All that and a bag of Grimore chips. As Dark Arts reduces the cost of, casting time, and recast time of your nukes. It also will improve your C+ Enfeebling Skill to a B+.<br />
On the flip side Light Arts provides a healing skill you actually need. Meaning you stand a better chance at removing Doom with Cursna. More powerful cures aren't a terrible thing either.<br />
You don't always have a SCH with you as well which means casting storms on yourself and others, such as a COR, is valuable.
}}
{{Guide Support Jobs
|Border Color=#51414F
|Job=SAM
|Notes=While not everyone's first thought as a support job. /SAM is situationally a very useful one. BLM can and should step up to weapon skill and open or close SCs when appropriate. However, it also can close them with itself whether it is with Occult Acumen or via meleeing. This is especially fun with AM3 on Laevateinn where you can three step your own Light or Dark SCs thanks to Hasso.

While it may seem counter intuitive to cast with Hasso on given the 50% penalty to casting and recasting. You are only likely getting one burst off anyway without a quick magic proc, and [[Elemental Celerity]] helps you to counter the penalty with a desisted Hasso Fast Cast set leveraging it.

==Understanding Magic==
===Magic Accuracy===

<hr style="background:#51414F; height: 1px;">
Writeup by [[User:Spicyryan]].
*Outside of minor edits please use the discussion page for the guide to discuss any major edits or corrections.
<hr style="background:#51414F; height: 1px;">
When it comes to being a BLM it is more an exercise in what you know about the foe and what you know about mechanics than just going boom-booms. It is easier for a DD to flub their way through than for you to. So let's go over the rigamarole so that we might all suck less.

While melee combat skills provide a corresponding boost to accuracy and attack at a rate of less than 1:1. Magic skill+ are a 1:1 skill to accuracy gain, but provide no extra attack.

To determine your magic accuracy total. Add up your elemental skill, magic accuracy skill, magic accuracy+, merits, gifts, food, buffs, debuffs, and then factor in dINT. Which is in the section below.
*A Mastered BLM with a Master Level of 0 will sit at 512 before any equipment or dINT.
:*Adding an Mpaca's Staff R0 would add 40 Magic Accuracy and 255 skill for 807.

<hr style="background:#51414F; height: 1px;">
Your hit rate is simply your magic accuracy against the magic evasion of your foe. Magical hit rate caps at 95%. Meaning 5% of the time a player will otherwise be resisted.
*If your magic hit rate is 50% or more then magic accuracy +1 is equivalent to hit rate +1%.
*If your magic hit rate is less than 50% then magic accuracy +1 is equivalent to hit rate +0.5%.
**Any Magic accuracy that raises you to the 50% mark then returns to being 1:1.
***E.g. Your hit rate is 40% and you gain 40 magic accuracy. Your hit rate becomes 60%.
However, the magic evasion of the foe is not actually simple. It is a factor of the foe's magic evasion stat, dINT, the resistance tier of the corresponding element of the foe, and level correction where applicable.
*Thus, there is no single magic accuracy number to cap hit rate for a foe as there would be a physical accuracy.
<hr style="background:#51414F; height: 1px;">
INT also plays a role in the magic accuracy of all nukes and INT based enfeebles. The magic accuracy bonus of INT depends on two things:
#dINT, the difference of INT between caster and foe.
#[[Magic Hit Rate]], which we covered, but factors in here.

{| style="width: 100%; max-width: 788px; text-align: center; color: #BDB5D5; background: #1B1212" cellpadding="2"
! colspan="8" | dINT and Magic Accuracy+

| -70 ~ -31

| -10 ~ +10
| +11 ~ +30
| +31 ~ +70
| >+70
|- style= "color: #E3DFEE; background: #756464"

| +0
| +0-10
| +10-20
| +20-40
| +40-50
| +50-60
| +60
|}

So, INT has a sweet spot from -10 to +10, but also a no-no spot, and that spot is 70+. Which by that age you don't expect much anyway.
\*Ba-dum-tss

Now, once your INT has become magic accuracy it affects your magic hit rate in the same way as above. For example:

Your magic hit rate is 65%.
*dINT is +30, and you gain 19 INT.
:*Your hit rate is now 69%. Nice.
*dINT is -38 and you gain 19 INT.
:*Your hit rate is now 72%.

Your magic hit rate is 45%.
*dINT is -50 and you gain 20 INT.
:*Your hit rate is now 47%.
*dINT is -10 and you gain 20 INT.
:*Your hit rate is now 60%.

WAR (Crawler above) is the most common job in the game, and it is the second lower tier of INT, where PLD (Beetle above) is the lowest ranking of INT.<br />
This should probably have a table on the [[INT]] page, but for now I will just write it here from highest to lowest.
#BLM
#SMN
#DRK, COR, SCH, THF, RDM
#BRD, BLU, NIN, RUN
#BST, PUP, RNG, SAM, WHM
#DNC, DRG, WAR

<hr style="background:#51414F; height: 1px;">
The [[Resist]]ance of a foe is the final and most important piece of the puzzle. Not only for magic accuracy, but for damage. Though we will only cover the accuracy portion of that here, just like with INT.

First, let me just summarize the resist page here in terms of accuracy. Foes have individual resistances to all elements, and these values are tiered out in the table above. A neutral resistance tier is 100%, where as weakness would be anything above that, and vice versa for resitance.<br />
Any foe with a resistance status of 50% forces a resist. Resists will be either a 1/2 (-50%), 1/4 (-75%), or 1/8th (-87.5%). So a Skeleton for example, has a {{dark}} dark resistance tier of 50%. This means any dark based spell which lands is not going to either be full damage or full duration.

Now, there are two things players can do to change the resistance, [[Rayke]] and [[Skillchain]]s.
*Rayke reduces the resistance tier to the corresponding element by a tier per rune.
:*E.g. a foe has a 30% resistance tier to an element, and three runes of that element are Rayked. The reistance tier is now 60% for the duration of Rayke, which is a big deal.
*Skillchains will temporarily lower the resistance tier of the damage of the skillchain by one tier for the window of it.
:*Magic bursting also adds a speculated +100 accuracy to a spell.
:*See the [[Resist#Modifying Resistance Rank]] for more explanation on how a SC damage type is determined.
::*It is the lowest resistance tier, but this can change depending on other steps involved.
This becomes very applicable with NMs, which can tend to have different resistance values from ordinary foes of the same family or even other NMs. For example, no tier 3 [[Odyssey]] NM in Sheol Gaol has a weakness above 30% unless their aura is on which then changes it to 100% iirc. With their neutral elements being 25% and their opposing element at the lowest 5% tier.<br />
This means if you fight a foe like Ongo then the magic defense down from [[Vidohunir]] will not land outside of when the aura is on. Same for defense down effect from a weapon skill against [[Xevioso]]. In fact to finish that thought, they will only really stand a chance to land against Mboze unless Rayke is used.

Further, as a BLM you can uniquely bypass some of the hindrance of Resist tiers while under [[Subtle Sorcery]]. It will bypass the forced resists from a tier 50% or less, but will not solve the next component of elemental resistance tiers.

Second, the remaining factor to resistance to account for is the magic accuracy requirements imposed by resistance tiers. Which is not actually on the wiki currently. Not because I am some rumored gate keeper, but because neither I nor anyone else have gotten around to it, and it involves deciphering Japanese testing through google Translate. Not the easiest for sure, but what is clear is that as resistance tiers go lower and resistance to an element goes higher. It imposes a greater magic accuracy requirement to cap hit rate.
*[https://twitter.com/MBZ2arZNkm174sV/status/1292994041722724352?cxt=HHwWgICjmd_O0fEjAAAA Here] is the testing I am referring to, and one which corroborates the INT magic accuracy/Ongo testing from Lutes blog cited at the bottom references on both of those pages.
:*The red text is confirmed, and the black is theorized.
:*This testing lines up with the observable effective magic accuracy required for [[Ongo]], 1,365.
::*Since you are magic bursting, yes, the resistance rank changes from 30% to 40% for the burst window, and changes the accuracy required to 1,222 before counting the +100 from bursting.
:\*Accuracy requirements jump steeply below the 30% tier. The table lacks it for Ongo, but I can make an educated guess based on the data there. Which means you need an effective magic accuracy of ~1,710 to land Burn on Ongo, given it's 25% tier to fire.
Now the testing doesn't go past the 20% tier, but it doesn't need to with how steep it gets. So when it comes to nuking, SC dmg, or enfeebling any iLvl foe around the lowest tiers, forget about it unless you throw the kitchen sink at the foe. Which generally isn't practical.

Fortunately, there is a lower magic accuracy requirement for the higher resistance tiers. Let's tie this together with a practical example using a level 139 [[Apex Draugar]]. Which has a resistance tiers of {{fire}} 130%, {{ice}} 70%, and {{dark}} 50%. Spells would cap hit rate at the following:
_{{fire}} 1,102
_{{ice}} 1,204
*{{dark}} 1,295
:*Due to the forced resist, if you casted sleep. Then you will either not land the spell or it will land for a reduced time.

What is cool about all of this this is that outside of anything that lowers your macc or boosts the magic evasion of the foe, you can better figure out or fine tune a set to cap hit rate.

\*Values in the table are based off of: [https://sazitouhuu.blogspot.com/2020/06/blog-post_27.html].
**Resistance Ranks are linear per level while the various ranks for that level are exponential increases as resistance increases.
**While working to extrapolate the table further from the source material. I noticed errors and questioned some results. Thus comes in my friend, Fox. Of which this final table is credited to.
**_There was not enough data collected for the 20% and 25% ranks, but it is safe to say the curve gets steep.
_**Keep in mind, the table is estimated values built off of another table of very well estimated values. Expect that you may possibly be off by ~10 magic accuracy at a given time.

Practical implications of the write up:
*Gear enfeebles like sleep or break with a focus in magic accuracy and enfeebling skill.
*Magic Hit Rate caps at 95%, and a miss is simply a reist, which has various values.
*The value of macc from INT depends on dINT. It can be as large as +1 or as low as +0.
*Resistance Ranks aka Resistance Tiers can dramatically impact magic accuracy.

<hr style="background:#51414F; height: 1px;">
For free nuking, the three stats to focus on initially are Intelligence (INT), Magic Attack Bonus (MAB) and Magic Accuracy (M.Acc).<br />
A higher [[dINT]] value, when your  INT is in tiers (+50, +100, +200, etc) above the mob's INT, results in a stronger spell. While a higher MAB results in a better MAB/MDB ratio compared to your target.
