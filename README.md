# KAIUS'S FFXI GEARSWAP

A set of [GearSwap](https://docs.windower.net/addons/gearswap/) job files for FFXI.

The gear sets and principles are current as of July 2023, limited of course by my current progression. What does that mean?

- I have taken out 'ACC' modes from many/most jobs. Generally master levels, food, and buff adjustments suffice to find the appropriate level of accuracy for given content.
- I have added PDL modes for many jobs and will likely be adding more. With master levels, gear progression, and Sortie content, PDL is becoming situationally critical.
- I am trying to accomodate switching between TVR rings by using the set_combine() feature to ensure that no-matter what ring I currently own, all gearsets will be optimized without manually updating the code.
- I do still use [GearInfo](https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo) to determine current haste levels and potentially adjust DW accordingly. Yes, I try to always be haste capped, but sometimes $%#& happens, and I like to still swing fast when it does.

Nearly all of my Luas are based on the work of [Arislan](https://github.com/ArislanShiva/luas) and [Mote](https://github.com/Kinematics/Mote-libs/tree/master) before him.
The Auto-Ammo feature of the Corsair LUA is the work of [Selindrile](https://github.com/mattwells/Selindrile-GearSwap).
